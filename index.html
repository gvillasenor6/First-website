<h1>Hello Kitty</h1>    
<p>Created in 1974 by the Japanese merchandising company Sanrio and known internationally as Hello Kitty, Kitty White is a small, round-faced, cartoon catlike girl with black eyes, a yellow nose, no mouth, and a red bow perched on her left ear. Sanrio maintains that Hello Kitty is a girl and not a cat, although she displays feline characteristics such as pointed ears, whiskers, and a tail. According to the “biography” established by Sanrio, Hello Kitty was born in suburban London, where she lives with her parents and her twin sister, Mimmy. Among the simple pleasures she enjoys are baking cookies, playing the piano, and, above all, making friends. The third-grader’s playmates include a rabbit, a bear, a raccoon, and a pair of monkeys. Hello Kitty’s primary-coloured, simple, and <b>wholesome world</b> appealed to young children.</p>
